# Content-Recommendation-System

Developed a content-based movie recommendation system using machine
 learning vectorization techniques. Utilized Python, Pandas, and Streamlit to
 create a web application that suggests the top 10 movies similar to the
 user's input based on content. Leveraged the TMDB Movies API to extract
 relevant data from JSON files.
